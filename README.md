# Guessing Game :game_die:

Welcome to the guessing game! :tada: This is a simple game written in Rust where you need to guess a number between 1 to 100. :thinking:

## How to Play

To start the game, simply run the command ./guessing_game in your terminal window. You will be prompted to enter your guess. :keyboard:

If your guess is higher than the number, you will be notified with the message "Too high!". If your guess is lower than the number, you will be notified with the message "Too low!". :arrow_up_down:

Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number, and you will be congratulated with the message "You win!" :tada:
